# Operation Hole in One

I'll start this post with this poem composed by agent @HDTrung

Operation **Hole In One** was up and running.

Plan was made, and tasks were assigned. Keys and items were distributed to every agents involved.

Agent @keretapir flew from Malaysia to Ho Chi Minh City and gave us the target portal keys.

The night before jump time, we covered the city center to prevent any unwanted blocks from being made. Agent @lukenguyen was tasked for making the plan, and assigning people works for the covering field.

The shard spawned 1 hour earlier than what we expected, giving us some more excitement.

Just mere minutes before time to link to the goal portal, new blocks appeared, but they were quickly destroyed, thanks to agent @r3d10tu5. The link was established successfully.

A light wave of attack started near jump time. Resistance agents tried to flip the portal, but we had already made precaution. Agents onside successfully defended the shard portal with recharging and remodding, and finally shard 22 was goaled nicely in the very first jump of phase 2.

Thank you everyone, for your help, those who brought us together to make this exciting operation, who gave us tips on how to fight on ground, who were constantly checking the situation. And especially, thank every agents who joined onside or offside.

Here is the list of the ground agents in Vietnam. Apologies to Malaysian agents, since even your coordinator is unable to list you all :D
