One guy, 3 weeks off school, and a bit of a wanderlust... so, what do? Of course, backpacking around Mekong (Cuu Long) Delta for a BAF op! Planning started 2 weeks before the op, and after a ton of changes and different options, everything was set. Anchor points would be in Chau Doc, Ca Mau and Ho Chi Minh City, and after local players helped me with killing some block links, I was set.

Grab your beer, grilled squid, plastic chair and sit down, this is a long ass tale to be told.

----------------------------------------------------------

# Op Rice Fields Part 1: Monsoon Season

Started at 8pm on Sunday, 4th June, I took an intercity bus all the way from HCMC to Ca Mau, the southern tip of Vietnam. And first thing first, rain. Stupid rain lasted for half a day, but that doesn't stop me from making the extra 60km from Ca Mau to Dat Mui, the very tip of Vietnam. A few hours of key farming and talking with the locals, I was satisfied with 50+ keys.

Back to the city, room was cheap, somehow shittier than the dorm I stay in, food was cheap, beer was cheap (yeah mom I only had one, no mom I wasn't drunk), life was good. Ca Mau didn't have much sight to offer, so Phase 2 began right after on Monday morning. To kill a block link in Tien Giang, it involved a long distance bus from Ca Mau to Can Tho, the central city of Mekong Delta; from there, an old shitty bus probably twice my age and no air-con to the nearby Vinh Long city, and a motorcycle taxi (fk yeah cheap Vietnam transportation) to cross the river to Tien Giang province and to a temple literally out of no goddamn where, and smash the block link while trying to appear as less suspicious as possible. Welp, then the same way back, got to Can Tho by noon, and off we went to Chau Doc in the late afternoon.

Chau Doc was indeed a beautiful city. But anyway, Phase 3 was done within the night, taking a 5km walk around the city to link the spine to Ca Mau and throwing a block-blocker back to HCMC (yes mom I slept early). The next morning, I visited a famous temple there, before heading back to HCM for the final step.

And the screw up began. Even though I was in the middle of the city, Internet connection was lost for half an hour for no absolute reason. 3 phone calls to customer service and a hundred swear words later, it was back up. Made it to the anchor portal, killed some small blocks, killed the block-blocker that I set up, and then...

Battery was 10%. Main powerbank was dry, backup powerbank which I've charged up failed. (Lesson learned, never trust a powerbank that has been left untouched for half a year). No charging outlet in any convenience store around, I made a mad dash to the portal, and managed to link to the spine before battery ran out. That was only 6 layers out of the planned 11; still, it was good enough to net me 51.4 million MU. Good day.

I couldn't take a screenshot of the intel in time, so I fired up my laptop the moment I reached home half an hour later. And... it was gone. Block links were already thrown by a (banned spoofer) RES from another city. No more stacking.

----------------------------------------------------------

10 days, a spoofer ban, and 500 kiloprayers per minute later...

# Operation Rice Fields 2: Second Harvest was green lit, after the block links have decayed

Since there were already fields in place, I couldn't use the old spine anymore (cyka blyat that was a good spine), so I settled for a 3 portal spine near the Western edge of Ho Chi Minh City.

This time round, everything was pretty good...except the checkpoint was 9am, meaning I had to leave the house by 7 (yeah, I don't have a bike, bus is as reliable as weather forecast). And half an hour before checkpoint, it was up: bigger, thiccer, greener, with 9 layers and a total of 62.8 million MU.

So that was it, a wild tale to be remembered. Special thanks to team HCMC (@HDTrung, @lukenguyen, @TheITFox, @daolongnam) for assisting in killing blocks and emotional support, and @Ozryel in Singapore for making the spine plan in HCMC (which, welp, couldn't make it)
